Step 1: We start by navigating to the Admin Panel after you have logged in to your storylens.io account.

You will also see a snapshot of your existing pages. If you want to edit or delete an existing page, simply hover your mouse over the desired page and choose the relevant option among those that pop up.

Step 4: Let us start with adding a new page. To start, click the ‘+ Add New Page’ button as indicated above. This will lead to a pop-up where you can name your new page.   
  
Once done, you can click ‘Create’. You can always go back and edit the page as and when required.

As you name your page, you will notice that a URL for the page is auto-populated.

Step 5: You should now be able to see your newly created page as a blank canvas.

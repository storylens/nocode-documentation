Once you have your basic blog page up and running, this guide will walk you through the steps to add your domain, verify your ownership and publish once all the steps are completed.   
  
Lets get started!  
  
Adding Your Domain  
  

Step 1: After you have logged in to your account and land on your personal storylens.io page, click ‘Go to Admin Panel’ on the top left of the page.

Step 4: You will be presented with three stages to connect your domain to your storylens.io page.

Stage 1: Add Domain – Enter the exact domain name you want people to see when they visit your site. It can be a domain (yourdomain.com) or a subdomain (app.yourdomain.com). Once done, click ‘Continue’ to proceed to the next stage.

Stage 2: Verify Domain - After adding your domain name, you will be given a set of TXT records that need to be added to your DNS provider for your domain to be verified.

You also have the option to change your domain name at this stage if required. Once the records have been added to your domain, click ‘Verify’ to proceed to the next stage.
